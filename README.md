# AST.vim


## Installation

It is recommended to use one of the popular plugin managers for Vim. There are
many and you probably already have a preferred one, but a few examples for your
copy-and-paste convenience:

#### Pathogen

    $ git clone https://github.com/MaicoTimmerman/ast.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/ast.vim

#### Vim Plug

```vim
Plug 'MaicoTimmerman/ast.vim'
```

#### Vundle

```vim
Plugin 'MaicoTimmerman/ast.vim'
```

#### NeoBundle

```vim
NeoBundle 'MaicoTimmerman/ast.vim'

```

#### Manual (not recommended)

[Download][releases] the plugin and extract it in `~/.vim/` (or
`%PROGRAMFILES%/Vim/vimfiles` on Windows).
